# PiEar In Ear Monitor

## About

PiEar is an open source in-ear monitor system. Developed under the MIT liccence, it is a simple, easy to use, and free to use in-ear monitor system.

## Description

 As the name suggests, it is envisioned to be a Raspberry Pi-based system. Currently, I do not have a Raspberry Pi to test this on, so I can only say it works on my desktop (running Arch Linux). I also do not have any way to develop for the IOS platform, but I would love to see a version for that.
